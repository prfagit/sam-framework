## SAM Framework Additional Terms

### Building Tools and Integrations

If you intend to build tools, integrations, plugins, or any derivative works on top of the SAM Framework:

1. **Contact Requirement**: You MUST contact the SAM Framework developer on X (@prfa) or GitHub (https://github.com/prfagit) before publicly releasing or distributing any tools built on top of SAM.

2. **$SAM Token Holder Benefits**: Your tools MUST provide demonstrable benefits to holders of the $SAM token, including but not limited to:
   - Rewards distribution to $SAM token holders
   - Points system participation for $SAM stakers
   - Revenue sharing mechanisms that benefit $SAM holders
   - Integration with the $SAM ecosystem rewards program

3. **Ecosystem Participation**: Tools built on SAM should actively participate in the broader $SAM ecosystem by:
   - Supporting $SAM token as a payment/reward mechanism
   - Contributing to the network effects that increase $SAM token utility
   - Following the established patterns for $SAM rewards distribution

4. **Transparency**: You must clearly disclose in your tool's documentation and marketing materials:
   - That your tool is built on the SAM Framework
   - How it benefits $SAM token holders
   - Any revenue sharing or reward mechanisms implemented

### Failure to Comply

Failure to contact the developer and demonstrate benefits to $SAM token holders may result in:
- Removal of tool access from the official SAM ecosystem
- Incompatibility with future SAM Framework updates
- Legal action for violation of these additional terms

### Contact Information

For inquiries about building on SAM Framework:
- X (Twitter): @prfa (https://x.com/prfa)
- GitHub: https://github.com/prfagit
- Website: https://prfa.me

These additional terms are designed to ensure the SAM ecosystem grows in a way that benefits all $SAM token holders and maintains the integrity of the framework's economic model.
