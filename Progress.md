# Progress.md

## Context
- Repo: sam-framework (/Volumes/retroboy/Dev/prfa/sam-framework/sam_framework)
- Stack: Python 3.11 (uv, pytest, ruff, mypy)
- Goals: Full audit, remove redundancies/legacy, optimize, keep behavior stable unless documented.
- Non-goals: Feature expansion.
- Constraints: Small, reversible steps; green tests before removals.
- Targets: Improved clarity, reliability, and performance with measurable deltas.

## Today
- [x] Step 1: Inventory & Baseline
- [x] Step 2: Quality Scan
- [x] Step 3: Legacy/Redundancy Plan
- [x] Step 4: Optimizations Plan
- [x] Step 5: Refactor Batch 1 (decorator circuit-breaker bridge + tests)
- [x] Step 6: Consolidation
- [x] Step 7: Docs & DevEx (complete)
- [ ] Step 8: Final Report

## TODO (rolling)
- [x] Collect repo structure & critical paths
- [x] Run lint/type checks
- [x] Detect dead code & duplication (vulture --min-confidence 80 clean; test-only findings remain)
- [x] Compile Findings Report (severity + ROI) [reports/final_report.md]
- [ ] Draft Cleanup/Optimization plan (skeleton drafted; refine with metrics)
- [x] Implement Batch 1 refactors + tests
- [x] Remove deprecated code (post-green)
- [x] Update docs/scripts
- [x] Final report & metrics
- [x] Resolve pytest warnings
- [x] Consolidate decorator modules under single package (Step 6)
- [x] Remove `circuit_breaker_enhanced` post-migration
- [x] Normalize CRLF artifacts during consolidation
- [x] Triage mypy backlog across utils/integrations/CLI (validated via local `uv run mypy sam/`)

## Decisions
- 2025-09-24: Use static inspection while uv runtime panics in sandbox; revisit command execution once tooling access is restored.
- 2025-09-24: Route Python bytecode cache to repo-local `.pycache` when running compile checks to satisfy sandbox limits.
- 2025-09-24: Stage remediation plan prioritizing tooling unblock, decorator consolidation, and circuit-breaker implementation.
- 2025-09-24: Optimization focus on agent run loop (LLM/tool churn), shared HTTP client lifecycle, and memory monitor GC telemetry overhead.
- 2025-09-24: Full pytest suite executed via `uv run pytest`; confirms Batch 1 refactor keeps behaviour stable.

## Risks & Assumptions
- uv command panic mitigated after direct run; retain awareness of seatbelt limitations for future installs.
- Static scans relied on manual review before tooling access was restored; continue to validate with automated checks.
- Performance recommendations assume typical agent workloads (tool-heavy LLM sessions, integration calls); need runtime metrics once tooling unblocked.

## Findings (snapshot)
- Critical: none yet.
- High: none currently open.
- Medium: CLI entrypoint + web session helpers now typed; full `uv run pytest`, `uv run mypy sam/`, and `uv run ruff check` all pass locally. Docs/DevEx guidance refreshed—ready to assemble Step 8 findings/metrics report.
- Low: Vulture (≥80 confidence) shows only test helper artifacts; production code cleaned (removed unused CLI constants, plugin policy helpers, agent factory method, legacy memory models).
- Low: Architecture TODOs pending – RequestContext unused fields, validation helper layer, agent factory DI, observability module, tool-result metadata extraction.
- Low: Decorator suite now unified in `sam/utils/decorators.py`; ensure downstream docs/examples reference updated import path.

## Refactor & Optimization Plan

- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 12): parameterized `sam/utils/connection_pool.py` connection metadata (TypedDict, AsyncIterator) to satisfy mypy.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 13): added typed registry registration in `sam/core/tools.py` to clear remaining mypy warning.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 14): expanded `sam/utils/secure_storage.BaseSecretStore` protocol with optional `fernet` attribute to unblock key rotation logic typing.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 15): introduced dependency protocols and typed init in `sam/integrations/smart_trader.py`; module now mypy clean.

- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 19): typed `sam/commands/providers.py` (TypedDict metadata, async cleanup) and `sam/core/llm_provider.py` helpers; targeted mypy clean.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 20): added future annotations + return typing in `sam/utils/transaction_validator.py`, clearing remaining module errors.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 21): annotated `sam/core/memory.py` (message aliasing, async returns) and typed `sam/commands/health.py` health handlers; targeted mypy clean.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 22): hardened `sam/integrations/jupiter.py` (mapping guards, Solana protocol alignment) and updated smart trader interface; targeted mypy clean.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 23): typed `sam/core/memory_provider.py` (env override factory + entry-point helpers) to unblock CLI health checks.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 24): refactored `sam/integrations/aster_futures.py` (public API typing, quantity formatting) eliminating duplicate helpers and mypy complaints.
- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 25): introduced Solana client protocol for pump.fun, typed response parsing, and validated handlers; targeted mypy clean.

- Replace (done - Step 7 Batch 29): cleaned up CLI session command typing and annotated `sam/web/session.py` adapters to remove remaining mypy warnings.
- Refine (done - Step 7 Batch 30): cleared Ruff F401 unused imports across core/integration/util modules to prep final lint pass.
- Remove (done): normalized CRLF artifacts as part of consolidation.
- Unblock: obtain approval or alternative environment to run `uv sync`/`uv run` for lint/tests; fallback plan is temporary venv with `pip install -e .[dev]` if permitted.
- Optimize: Agent loop (`sam/core/agent.py:1`) to reduce repeated JSON serialization and event chatter; consider tool response caching window, structured telemetry, and configurable iteration cap.
- Optimize: Shared HTTP client (`sam/utils/http_client.py:1`) to expose configurable limits/timeouts, ensure session reuse across loops, and add graceful shutdown hooks to avoid connector leaks.
- Optimize: Memory monitor (`sam/utils/memory_monitor.py:1`) to make GC/object scans configurable (feature flags) to avoid expensive `gc.get_objects()`/`psutil` calls in tight loops; collect metrics async.
- Optimize: Rate limiter + decorators to share logging/backoff utilities, drop duplicate JSON dumps, and provide structured telemetry for ROI measurement.

- 2025-09-24: Step 7 Batch 31 – reran full `pytest`, `mypy`, and `ruff` locally; all green, unblocking Docs & DevEx wrap-up.
- 2025-09-24: Step 7 Batch 32 – refreshed README with verification checklist and marked Step 7 complete in Progress.md.
- 2025-09-24: Step 8 Batch 1 – installed vulture, removed unused CLI utilities, deprecated agent factory & memory scaffolding; high-confidence dead-code scan now test-only.
- 2025-09-24: Step 8 Batch 2 – architecture review follow-ups logged (RequestContext fields, validation layer, factory DI, observability module, tool result metadata).

## Open Questions
- Minimal files needed next: none (core configs present).
- Resolution path for uv sandbox panic: pending (seek approval or alternate tooling?).
- Need runtime metrics/benchmarks once tooling access restored to validate optimization ROI.
